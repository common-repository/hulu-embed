== Description ==

This plugin simplifies the effort involved in embedding videos for TV shows and movies from Hulu.com into your wordpress blog.

== Installation ==

To use the plugin, copy it to your wp-content/plugins directory and activate in the wordpress admin.

To embed a video, simply go to http://www.hulu.com/ and select the TV show or Movie that you want to embed and select the "Embed" icon next to the video.  In the embedding code there is a URL that looks simliar to the following:

http://www.hulu.com/embed/HoHzWbOm9DB0lMa8oT_AYg

To embed this URL simply enter a tag using the following format:

[hulu:url width height]

where width and height are optional.  So the URL above would be:

[hulu:http://www.hulu.com/embed/HoHzWbOm9DB0lMa8oT_AYg]

The width and height defaults to 510x295.
